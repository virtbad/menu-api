# Menu API

This is an api for the menu ecosystem. It does serve menus a sv-group restaurant in specific contexts. Additionally,
users, which are authenticated over a Microsoft account, may log in and rate the menus, using review comments or up- and
downvoting.

## Documentation

## Development Environment

To debug this api or to navigate its source code conveniently, you may clone the repository, and open it in your
favourite code editor. If you open it in IntellIJ Idea or something similar, you may just import the gradle Project and
get started. If you use a more primitive code editor you can build and run it using ```./gradlew bootRun```.
